# Inspiration

{.text-left} 

A combination between passion for building quality solutions, and growing frustration observing bad practices being commonly shared by quick blog posts, was one of the biggest motivator for engineering our scaffolding/accelerator packages. We've seen the risks associated when deploying data projects to the cloud with poor or lazy standards, and want to avoid this happening to any data practioner in the future! We all work with sensitive information where the right infrastructure—composed of robust security protocols, encryption, and access controls—creates a safe environment for experimentation, collaboration, and analysis. This scaffolding not only prevents unauthorized access but also fosters a culture of trust, where data practitioners can focus on refining their craft without worrying about data breaches or compliance issues.

We're open an honest about our experiences, and want to share the challenging moments just as much as the success stories. You can read more [here](/blog/bad-habbits) about how we've fallen into bad habbits, and why it's so important to change course.

# Experimentation
{.text-left}

The landscape for working with data is constantly changing, driven by the rapid advancement of technologies like machine learning, AI, cloud computing, and big data analytics. New tools, platforms, and methodologies emerge regularly, which means that today’s best practices can quickly become outdated. For data practitioners, this presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Keeping up with these changes can feel like a moving target, but experimentation is a powerful strategy for staying ahead.

By fostering a culture of continuous experimentation, data practioners can quickly test new technologies, techniques, and approaches without committing to long-term investments. OpenVERS helps to identify what works best for versatile use cases, from optimizing data pipelines to exploring new AI models. Experimentation also reduces risk by enabling small-scale, low-cost trials that provide valuable insights before scaling solutions. Additionally, through experimentation, data practioners can remain agile, ready to adapt as new trends or disruptive technologies appear. This proactive mindset not only helps in navigating the shifting data landscape but also ensures that organizations remain competitive, innovative, and on the cutting edge.
