Microsoft Azure is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that offers a wide array of services, including computing, storage, databases, analytics, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), and more. Azure enables data practitioners and developers to build, deploy, and manage applications and workloads in a flexible, scalable, and secure global network. When setting up Azure for the first time, establishing robust security measures is paramount for data practitioners to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their data and applications. Without proper security configurations, sensitive information can be exposed to unauthorized access, and accounts can become vulnerable to malicious activities if credentials are compromised. It's crucial to implement security best practices, such as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity and access management, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), network security groups (NSGs), and Azure Security Center recommendations. By prioritizing security from the outset, data practitioners can mitigate common risks like overly permissive access, unsecured storage accounts, and compromised credentials.

# Getting Started

The **Azure CLI** is a powerful command-line tool that allows users to interact with Azure services, enabling them to manage and automate various tasks such as creating and managing resources, deploying applications, and configuring services. Please visit the [Official Azure CLI Installation Instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to review the installation steps for your operating system.

For a comprehensive development experience, consider these additional tools:
*   **Azure PowerShell**: Provides a set of cmdlets to manage Azure resources directly from PowerShell. [Learn more about Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az).
*   **Azure SDKs**: Available for various programming languages (e.g., Python, .NET, Java, Node.js) to interact with Azure services programmatically. [Explore Azure SDKs](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/).
*   **Azure Tools for Visual Studio Code**: An extension that makes it easy to develop and deploy to Azure directly from VS Code. [Install Azure Tools for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack).
